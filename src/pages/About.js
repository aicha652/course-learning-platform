                    <p>
                        Our Platform was born out of a simple but powerful idea: learning should
                        be easy, enjoyable, and accessible to all.It all started when our founders
                        noticed how many passionate learners struggled to find resources that truly
                        helped them grow whether due to cost, language barriers, or lack of support.
                        With a background in technology and education, they decided to take action.
